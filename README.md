# AffineLabs Addressbook

The AffineLabs' Addressbook repository on GitHub is a valuable resource for developers and users of the AffineLabs platform. 
This repository contains a collection of static files that provide important information about the deployed contract addresses 
and application binary interfaces (ABIs) by the AffineLabs.
